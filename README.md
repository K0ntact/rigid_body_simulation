# Rigid Body Simulation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a physics engine that simulates the interaction of rigid bodies in 2D space. 3D interaction might be implemented in the future.

## Features
- [] Collision detection and response
- [] Accurate simulation in 2D
- [] Accurate simulation in 3D
